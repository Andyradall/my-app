            <div>
                <p>During 2020-2021 at Karrierestart, we noticed a substantial drop-off rate after sign-up. Many users weren't fully leveraging the full potential of the portal, leading us to a mission: revamp for better engagement.</p>
                <p>The project was particularly complex due to the platform's multi-sided nature, catering to both job-seekers, companies, and freelancers. At the same time covid put a strain on our resources. Our focus? Enhance UX without imposing heavy changes on our developers.<strong></strong></p>

                <h2><span class="font_c950ltmye">Doing Research in Covid Lockdown</span></h2>
            </div>
            <p>The objective was clear: enhance profile content on KS by increaing engagement. At the same time, there were challenges, like layoffs and the pandemic restrictions. The question we grappled with was, "How do we get user insights under these conditions?"</p>
            <h3>Proactive Measures:</h3>
            <p>To get insight into user behavior, I took initiative to integrate Hotjar on the portal. Its recordings and heatmaps vividly depicted areas where the user journey stuttered. Furthermore, I set up a feedback module, so we could zoom in on specific user pain points.</p>
            <h3>Remote Insights:</h3>
            <p>Traditional face-to-face interviews were off the table. Instead, I dispatched surveys for insights and turned to remote platforms like Teston.io and Usertesting.com. The remote validation of our designs turned out to be highly effective.</p>
            <h3>Fostering User Engagement:</h3>
            <p>With an eye on further amplifying user engagement, I studied Nir Eyal's Hook model. Then I explored ways to incorporate this framework into our platform.</p>

            <p>Hotjar feedback module gave me a lot of actionable feedback that I used to improve user exerience! Here on the whitelabled Aleris Company profile.</p>
            <h2>Key Actionable Insights</h2>
            <p>Through our research, several revelations stood out, shaping our approach and guiding the evolution of the Karrierestart platform. The insights became the pillars of our design strategy.</p>
            <p><strong>Enhance User Guidance:</strong> It was essential to offer users simple instructions on how to use the service to its fullest potential.</p>
            <p><strong>Gamify User Experience:</strong> Incorporating gamification elements like progress bars, badges, and challenges to motivate users and make the experience more enjoyable.<br><strong>Reduce Cognitive Load:</strong> Prioritizing essential features and minimizing the visual prominence of advanced options ensured that users weren't overwhelmed, leading to smoother navigation.<br></p>
            <p><strong>Leverage Behavioral Psychology:</strong> We integrated techniques such as variable rewards and nudges to subtly steer user behavior, aiming to magnify engagement levels.</p>
            <p><strong>Simplification and Standardization:</strong> To ensure consistency and foster collaboration, we built a design system and transitioned all design work to Figma.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I designed onboarding guides that we put on all the profiles.</p>
        <p><strong>Company Profile:</strong> In the company profile it was important to make it very simple to get started, and not overwhelm the users with complexity causing them to leave.</p>
        <p><strong>Progressive Unlocking:</strong> I designed the onboarding so that as users earned new badges, new sections and functionalities became accessible, gradually increasing their engagement with the platform.</p>
        <p><strong>Professionalism in Job Ads:</strong> We made certain steps like having a logo and "about us" text mandatory for publishing job ads, this ensured a consistently polished appearance for all published job listings.</p>

        <p>To better serve the user's need for information, I created stories to convey a lot of information quickly and easily. The challenging element here was working with the developers to and creating the CMS for creating the stories and getting the code perfect. I decided to use Undraw for all illustrations on the portal as it provided a free and consistent resource for illustrations fitting well with the overall brand.</p>
