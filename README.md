# Anders RÃ¥dal's UX/Interaction Design Portfolio

Welcome to my UX/Interaction Design Portfolio. This repository showcases my work and projects in the field of user experience and interaction design. It's built using SvelteKit, a powerful framework for building web applications, and uses Tailwind CSS for sleek, responsive designs.

### Key features and technologies include:
- **SvelteKit**: For building highly interactive user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid custom design development.
- **Performance Optimization**: Achieved a perfect 100 score in Google PageSpeed while also enabling analytics like GA4 and Hotjar, showing a strong focus on site speed and user experience.

This portfolio represents my commitment to creating high-quality, performant web applications and my ability to leverage the latest technologies in web development.
